## Introduction

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the largest public transportation agency in New England, delivering a complex system of subway, bus, commuter rail, light rail, and ferry services to riders in the dynamic economy of the Greater Boston Area. It is estimated that MBTA provides over 1.3 million trips on an average weekday. While MBTA collects a wealth of trip transaction data on a daily basis, a persistent limitation has been the organizationâ€™s lack of knowledge around rider groups and their respective ridership habits. Understanding rider segmentation in the context of pattern-of-use has significant implications in developing new policies to improve its service planning and potentially changing its fare structure.


## Project Deliverables
This repo contains code documentation for both of our deliverables:

## Github Organization Structure
- **Rider-Segmentation-Full-App**: [This](https://github.com/AC297r-MBTA-2018/Rider-Segmentation-Full-App) is the code base for both the Python segmentation package and the app with full functionality (i.e. based on user input, the app is able to send clustering request to the Flask backend on a new data set or user-specified weights/duration that has not been cached. Disclaimer: The full input source is not available on Github for security reasons, and each new clustering request takes at least several hours.)
- **Dashboard**: [This](https://github.com/AC297r-MBTA-2018/Dashboard) is the static version of the full app that has limited functionality (The app is only able to display pre-ran monthly clustering results for Dec 2016 to Nov 2017 with equal weighting on temporal, geographical and ticket purchasing pattern.) The app is deployed as a Github page (https://ac297r-mbta-2018.github.io/Dashboard/).
- **Final-Report**: [This](https://github.com/AC297r-MBTA-2018/Final-Report) repository hosts the final report which is deployed as a Github page (https://ac297r-mbta-2018.github.io/Final-Report/).
- **Code-Documentation**: [This](https://github.com/AC297r-MBTA-2018/Code-Documentation) repository hosts the content of this code documentation which is deployed as a Github page, *current page*.

Note: The limited Dashboard, Final Report and Code Documentation are linked via a navigation bar on respective Github pages.



## Full Package Structure

The high-level functionality of this rider segmentation package is to group individual MBTA riders according to pattern-of-use dimensions. Our full package has the following structure:

A brief item description for ```MBTAdashboard```:

- `app.py` module handles the communications between the front-end dashboard and the back-end Python codes. This is based on the Flask platform.
- `src` directory contains a `utils.py` which is the back-end engine of the dashboard and a `json_generator_driver.py` which generates static json files for use in the limited Github version of the dashboard.
- `static` directory contains static css, javascript and image files for the dashboard.
- `templates` directory contains html files to render the dashboard.

A brief item description for ```MBTAriderSegmentation```:

- `config.py` module sets global constants (e.g., data path, file prefix, rider type dictionary) that are used in the other modules.

- `features.py` module extracts different sets of rider-level features ([details](https://ac297r-mbta-2018.github.io/Final-Report/feature.html)) from transaction-level data and save the extracted features in the `data/cached_features/` directory.

- `segmentation.py` module handles the actual rider segmentation procedure and saves the rider features with its cluster assignment in the `data/cached_clusters/` directory.

- `profile.py` module profiles the clusters by summarizing cluster pattern-of-use features, inferring cluster demographics distributions as well as calling `report.py` module to produce a short descriptive text for each cluster. The cluster profiles are saved in the `data/cached_profiles/` directory.

- `report.py` module handles automatic report generation. It is called by `profile.py`, and its results are appended as a an additional column to the cluster profiles data frame that is eventually saved in the `data/cached_profiles/` directory.

- `visualization.py` module contains functions to generate various static visualizations to explore the clusters in python.

- `[]_driver.py` files contain sample usage code for the indicated module (e.g. features_driver.py is sample code foe the features.py module). The only module without a driver.py is `report.py` because it is not directly used by users.

- `Manully_Label_Clusters.ipynb` notebook contains starter code to manually label clusters to train the auto report generator.

- `Train_Report_Model.ipynb`  notebook contains starter code to train the auto report generator.

- `data` directory contains the input data files from MBTA and external data sources (i.e., US census, MA geojson, MBTA geojson, MBTA AFC/ODX, MBTA fare product, MBTA stops) and output files from various modules in this package (i.e. extracted feature in `cached_features`, segmentation results in `cached_clusters`, profiled cluster summaries in `cached_profiles`, cached cluster geographical distribution visualizations in `cached_viz`, and a trained CNN model to classify temporal patterns in `report_models`).

    Note: the segmentation module creates subdirectories in the `cached_clusters` directory when saving the result. Based on the choice of pipeline, the results are saved in  `hierarchical/results` or `non-hierarchical/results` subdirectories. For reference, the segmentation module also saves the clustering Calinski-Harabaz scores of each algorithm (LDA and K-means) in `hierarchical/scores` or `non-hierarchical/scores` subdirectories. The profile module also creates subdirectories in the `cached_profiles` directory when saving the result. The name of the subdirectory it creates is based on the starting month and duration. For instance, for a start month = '1701' and a duration = 1, the resulting subdirectory is '2017-Jan'; for the same start month and a duration = 2, the resulting subdirectory is '2017-Jan_to_2017-Feb'.
